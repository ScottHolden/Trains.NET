### Background

Trains.NET is based on Trains originally created by James Formica, Scott Holden and David Wengier.

Trains is available to play online at https://jamesformica.github.io/trains (Mirror at https://wengier.com/trains if that doesn't work).

Trains2 is a fork of Trains that I started in order to clean up some things and add some features I wanted. It's available to play online at https://wengier.com/trains2 but you might be hard pressed to find the differences (hint: what happens when two trains are heading towards the same crossing).

Trains.NET is a complete re-write, from scratch, in .NET Core and C#, using SkiaSharp for drawing, because I like .NET Core and C# more than I like TypeScript. Every line of code is written (or reviewed) live on stream because I have an itch to live stream for some unknown reason.

### Get Involved

Because all coding happens on stream I'm unlikely to be able to accept large pull requests but small ones might be considered if I feel like they can be reviewed in a stream and I can fully explain them so nothing changes without the community being aware.

Comments, suggestions, questions, feature requests, stream requests etc. however are all very _very_ welcome, simple file an issue on this repository.

#### Development Quick Start Guide
- Clone the [Trains.NET](https://github.com/davidwengier/Trains.NET) repository
- Initialize the Comet submodule with `git submodule update --init`
- Open the project in Visual Studio 2019 (or similar IDE)
- Start debugging to confirm it works
